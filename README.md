# SpringWebAppBankApplication
Bank application implemented on spring web mvc

This is an implementation of the console based Bank app that we created from the very first day of our class. Later on we designed a GUI based on swing and implemented the same application in GUI based system.
While we were doing the GUI thing we tried our best to refactor the code and package it with MVC design pattern.
Now finally the project is implemented in Spring WEB MVC but certain refactoring like seperating the DAO and SERVICE layer is yet to be implemented.
